# ‼️ MAC ISSUES ‼️

Even though we auto build for MacOS on github actions, MacOS Builds were tested and seem to be broken. So these install files will not be provided for MacOS at this time. If you would like to fund some macOS builds (with real mac's building them), you can support the project on ko-fi! [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/darkwolfievt)


# ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

# Changes!

- Version 0.9.0-BETA-PreR1
- Implemented system font detection and updated the code to display these fonts for choosing as the theme for the overlay.
- Moved to the official twitch API and eventsub websocket server. 
- Mac Builds still run for now but may be removed in the future due to it not working on actual MacOS Physical Machienes.


## ‼️ IMPORTNAT !! 

Once v1.0.0 is released, the mock websocket server will be removed and the real one will be used. At this time, Twitch EventSub is not used.

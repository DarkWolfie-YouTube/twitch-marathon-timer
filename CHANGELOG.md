# ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️
This release is signed (for windows) and not verified. If the code signing is incorrect, the release is said to not work and may contain malicious code. If you have any issues, please report them [here](https://github.com/DarkWolfie-YouTube/twitch-marathon-timer/issues)


# Changes!

- Version v1
- Initial Release for public use!
- Full eventsub support for all events needed implmented.
- Logging system for debugging and issue making. 

- Font Support for overlay timer (if it doesn't display fonts, make an issue containing your log file.)


# Known issues

- MacOS Users can't see fonts. 
    At this moment in time, I am not sure why this is what it is. I will fix this later as this was originally ment for a windows only project. If you know how to fix this, please fork and change what is needed to change and make a pull request.

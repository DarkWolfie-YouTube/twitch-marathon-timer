# ‼️ MAC ISSUES ‼️

Even though we auto build for MacOS on github actions, MacOS Builds were tested and seem to be broken. So these install files will not be provided for MacOS at this time. If you would like to fund some macOS builds (with real mac's building them), you can support the project on ko-fi! [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/darkwolfievt)
